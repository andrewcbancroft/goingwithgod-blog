As a dad looking for a way to lead my family in devotions for Holy Week, I was thrilled when I heard that <a title="Desiring God" href="http://www.desiringgod.org" target="_blank">Desiring God</a> had released a daily devotion guide for this week leading up to Easter. Courtney and I (and Silas, though he was still preparing for his big day) really enjoyed reading the Advent series during Christmas, so I was excited to see the Holy Week counterpart, <a title="Love to the Uttermost" href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/love-to-the-uttermost-free-ebook-for-holy-week" target="_blank">&#8220;Love to the Uttermost&#8221;</a>.

And I was not disappointed. I cheated&#8230; I read all of it already. I highly, highly recommend this simple, yet powerful book. It&#8217;s designed to ignite our joy in Jesus by causing us to pause and reflect on his love for us, most visibly demonstrated and felt when he laid down his life and took it up again, so that undeserving sinners can be happy in God forever.

The devotions are

  * Clear and concise
  * Eye-opening
  * Joy producing
  * Jesus-glorifying

If you don&#8217;t yet have a plan for this week, it&#8217;s not too late. The devotions are short but powerful. You could even catch up if you don&#8217;t see this recommendation until mid-week. Head over to Desiring God&#8217;s site and <a title="Love to the Uttermost Download Link" href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/love-to-the-uttermost-free-ebook-for-holy-week" target="_blank">download this free eBook today</a>. For your joy!
