Isaiah 41:10 (ESV)
  
Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

&#8220;I am with you&#8221;, says God. &#8220;Therefore, fear not.&#8221;

&#8220;I am your God&#8221;, says God. &#8220;Therefore, be not dismayed.&#8221;

In righteousness God promises strength, help, and upholding. &#8220;I will&#8221;, God says. &#8220;I _will_.&#8221;

Faith sees these words and embraces them as reality. It looks and says, &#8220;Jesus bought that for me with his blood!&#8221;

Jesus bought God&#8217;s &#8220;God-ness&#8221; as I&#8217;m terming it. Because of this amazing reality, God is with me. God is my God, and he promises to be my strength and help, and to uphold me. God&#8217;s righteous right hand is _on my side_. All of this. For me (and you). In Jesus. Is it enough?

I&#8217;m asking God to persuade my heart at every inkling of doubt to trust and believe this solid ground as I face the uncertainty that is every single day of 2014. Join me.
