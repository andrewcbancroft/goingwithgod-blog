**1 Corinthians 7:17 , 24(ESV)**

**17** Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches. &#8230; **24** So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.

It&#8217;s my observation that many Christians, perhaps even the majority, perceive an unnecessary difference between two categories of vocation:  &#8220;secular&#8221; and &#8220;sacred&#8221;.

One thought of encouragement from Paul in his first letter to Corinth is that we don&#8217;t need to make that distinction.  At all.  The Lord has &#8220;assigned&#8221; his people to various vocations in this life.  Those assignments are &#8220;callings&#8221;.  Prior to verse 24, Paul makes clear that there are various cultural/ethnic and _vocational_ conditions that people were in when they began to treasure the glory of God in Jesus Christ.  It is in those various situations that Paul says &#8220;there let him remain with God&#8221;.

So it is my understanding that it is very possible &#8211; even essential for the purpose of accomplishing God&#8217;s whole purpose in the world, for Christians to be involved in _all kinds_ of jobs and workplaces.

&#8220;Remaining with God&#8221; carries a new perspective on &#8220;Going with God&#8221;.  When Christians remain in a particular vocation that is not directly connected to the church&#8217;s organizational structure, they don&#8217;t just go to work&#8230; they go to work &#8220;with God&#8221; in that they remained in that line of work even after they believed.  You are a &#8220;missionary&#8221; where you are by virtue of belonging to Jesus.

So, Christian &#8211; don&#8217;t just do your job.  Do your job &#8220;with God&#8221;.  Don&#8217;t just go to work.  Go to work &#8220;with God&#8221;.  By remaining in your vocation, you are fulfilling your God-given assignment.  You are working out your calling.  You are &#8220;Going with God&#8221; just as much as the Christian whose assignment happens to be among the unreached peoples of the world.

&nbsp;

One clarification &#8211; if your assignment is in a vocation not connected to the church&#8217;s organizational structure, God has assigned you there _not_ primarily to work to earn to have more for yourself, but to work to earn to _give generously_ to the causes and individuals who are assigned to making others happy in God around the world.  God has designed an _awesome_ partnership between goers and senders.  You&#8217;re one, the other, or perhaps even both.  **But no obedient Christian can be neither&#8230;**
