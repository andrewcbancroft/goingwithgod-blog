Oh the folly of a doctrine that would enable me to justify spending God-given resources on all kinds of luxurious purchases, believing that I can glorify God by simply being thankful that God gave me so much to buy them with!  Why would Jesus say to me &#8220;Sell your possessions, and give to the needy&#8221; if that teaching were true?  Doesn&#8217;t he teach me to store up treasure in heaven, not crave fleeting earthly possessions that I can&#8217;t even take with me when I die??!!

The words of pastor Jeffrey Singletary, Idlewild&#8217;s downtown campus pastor when I lived in Tampa, echo in my mind: &#8220;You were blessed to be a blessing!&#8221; YES!!
