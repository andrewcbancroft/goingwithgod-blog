&#8220;Ooooohh, now&#8230; how old is he??&#8221;  I love this question.  Really!  I do!  Every time I&#8217;m asked I get to talk about my kid, and that&#8217;s always fun.  But today, things just got even _more_ fun.  Now, instead of just telling people his approximate age, I can **show** them his _precise_ age down to the second!

As some of you know, I&#8217;ve been nerding out on learning to build iOS apps for iPhone and iPad.  Well, to celebrate Silas turning another month old, I built a little app that tells me how many years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds he is old.  I also built in functionality so that I can see how much longer it will be until his birthday (actually, I think I just thought of a bug with that part, but it won&#8217;t show itself until 2014 so I have time&#8230;it shouldn&#8217;t be nearly as bad as the Y2K panic &#8211; but date math is non-trivial, just so you know). _

And yes, for those of you who are just as OCD as I am, I did consider the fact that he was born at 12:06 AM (sorry&#8230;they didn&#8217;t give us the exact millisecond of his debut or I&#8217;d have that in there too).

Check out this video of the app showing his age as he turned 3 months old this morning!
