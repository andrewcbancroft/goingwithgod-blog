I recently starred in a documentary.  Well&#8230;  Sort of&#8230;

By &#8220;starred&#8221;, I mean it was basically all about my son, Silas, and Courtney and I were in it as &#8220;support roles&#8221;.  But who needs the details, right?  It&#8217;s probably better that my face appears less anyway &#8211; Silas&#8217; face is way cuter.

Seriously though, I was blown away by the talent of Ms. [Jordan Moss][1].  She did this video as a project for her degree &#8211; I give it an A+ (but of course I may be a tiny bit biased).

Enjoy this little glimpse into the Bancroft family!
