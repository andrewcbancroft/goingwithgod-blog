1 Corinthians 15:51–54 (ESV)
  
Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”

<p>My, how you’ve changed<br>
Was the regular refrain<br>
Each time we met again<br>
My Grandmother and I.</p>
<p>My, how you’ve changed.<br>
How you’ve grown<br>
In one year alone,<br>
For distance has sped my advance.</p>
<p>My, how you’ve changed<br>
Since I saw you last.<br>
Too long has passed!<br>
But alas we’re together again.</p>
<p>My, how you’ve changed<br>
It’s hard to ignore<br>
That you’ve changed more than ever before!</p>
<p>Or so it seemed to her.<br>
For I seemed the same to me<br>
And so did she.</p>
<p>Until the roles reversed.</p>
<p>My, how you’ve changed,<br>
For more often than not<br>
She forgot.<br>
This was our journey now.</p>
<p>My, how you’ve changed.<br>
We sit; we rehearse<br>
Our story’s verse.<br>
A final I love you.</p>
<p>My, how you’ve changed.<br>
Jesus whispers, “Come.”<br>
Her spirit runs.<br>
And she begins to give thanks.</p>
<p>Now I look to the day when<br>
In new bodies arrayed<br>
We in unison say,</p>
<p>My, <em>oh my</em>, how you’ve changed!</p>
